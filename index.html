  <p>
    I had an unexpected busy week so I just followed through the assignment and made a very bad looking website in order to complete it on time. Shame on me!
  </p>
  <h2>Devbootcamp</h2>
  <p>
    I plan on using this site to talk about DBC, tips I learned, and so on. Might even talk about this site. So meta.

  <h2>Step-By-Step Go-To-Guide </h2>
    <h3>Ordered List: Example Workflow</h3>
      <p>(If there is a cloned repo, start on step 3)</p>
      <ol> 
        <li>Create repo on GitHub</li>
        <li>Clone Repo - git clone [url]</li>
        <li>Go to folder - cd [repo-folder]</li>
        <li>Create Branch - git checkout -b [new-branch]</li>
        <li>(Optional)Create file - touch [filename]</li>
        <li>Edit file - subl [filename]</li>
        <li>Stage file - git add [filename](tip: git add --all)</li>
        <li>Commit file - git commit -m "commit message"</li>
        <li>Send changes to GitHub - git push origin [branch-name]</li>
        <li>Go to GitHub, review and merge there</li>
        <li>Back in terminal, go to master - git checkout master</li>
        <li>Pull changes from GitHub - git pull origin master</li>
      </ol>
      <p>TIP:You can do a initial commit on master with git push -u origin master and at the end use a simple git push to pull changes.</p>
  <h2>Another topic will go here</h2>
    <h3>Probably it will have some tables</h3>
    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th colspan="2"> It will have a heading</th> 
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> This will be </td>
        <td> The first row </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> And this one </td>
        <td> The second row </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  <h2>Additional resources</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://devbootcamp.instructure.com/courses">Here</a> I will add a link using href to DBC canvas. Unlike this site you are now at, DBC canvas has names and tags to pretty much every section, and even I, a total noob, can understand why. </p>
    <p>They use it to make everything neatly organized and easy to follow, for those reading the page and those who would later want to edit and it and improve it.  </p>
  <footer class="center">
    This is the footer! Thanks for visiting.
